# Language Master

Language Master is a web application designed to help students improve their foreign language pronunciation in a classroom setting. Similar to Quizlet, it uses flashcards to guide students through vocabulary practice, but with a unique feature: instant automated pronunciation feedback. This makes it an ideal tool for both students and teachers aiming to enhance language learning through practice and evaluation.
